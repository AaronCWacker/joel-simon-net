            A research project simulating the evolution of virtual corals. Corals are grown in underwater environments containing light and current flow and are evolved with a genetic-algorithm. Morphogens, signaling, memory and other biologically motived capacities enable a multipurpose biomemetic form optimization engine. This work is part of a series of projects exploring emergent and generative forms.

            Corals are not plants but colonies of genetically identical organisms called polyps which are attached to one another and act as a single entity. Polyps are actually very similar to Jellyfish and collect nutrients from a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic bacteria living inside them called Zooxanthellae and from small plankton which they catch. Polyps from stony-corals deposit calcium beneath them which produces their structures. There are many different types of corals with varying forms and home environments. Some do not consume Zooxanthellae and others do so entirely.

            The intent of this work was not to mimic underwater environments or Coral biology exactly, but rather to use them as guidelines for testing a form optimization method. The creation of and control over optimized and emergent forms, not limited by training data, interests me for its many potential applications in art, design and engineering.

        h1#background BACKGROUND
        :markdown
            One of my primary research interests was how growth enables complexity by expanding - or decoding - the genotype into the phenotype. This is researched by biologists and computer scientists. Within computer science this emergent mapping is studied often in the context of the complexity of the networks themselves. For example HyperNEAT is a neuroevolution method which uses a [Compositional pattern-producing network (CPPN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositional_pattern-producing_network) to map a smaller network to a larger one. CPPN's are a state of the art method for generating images[x], forms[x] and soft robots[x]. This mapping has been studied under the name embryogenesis [x, y]. Bentley [y] defines thee main types of embryogenies: external, explicit and implicit. External are user defined direct mappings with no growth, explicit are directly defined growth steps such as Lindenmayer and generative growth grammars, implicit do not explicitly define growth rules and emerge from multiple interacting and indirect rules.

            > Multicellular organisms are, of course, grown using the instructions provided in their genetic material. Living creatures grow as a result of a carefully choreographed dance of genes, amino acids, proteins, cells, chemical signals, electrical signals and movements. The unimaginable convolutions of interaction between all parts of the growing creature permit a small amount of information to generate immensely more complex forms. Because it implicitly encompasses concepts such as compression, iteration, recursion, adaptation and memory, a natural embryogeny is an inherently scalable process. Once evolved in nature, this growth process opened up the door to the evolution of every creature from fruit fly to blue whale.
            > -Bentley & Kumar [x]

            Embrygenesis and morphogenesis are, unsurprisingly, mostly studied by biologists who employ modeling systems to help understand the emergence of biological complexity and life within the subfield of developmental biology. Mathematician Alan Turing first formulated how interacting molecules, called morphogens, could establish chemical gradients through a process called reaction-diffusion system which would allow patterns to arise in otherwise homogeneous cells. While exact biological relevance of reaction-diffusion is debated the use of long range patterns and gradient are necessary for all biological development

            A good, if somewhat outdated  summary of the research for a computer science audience is [x](Kumar, Sanjeev, and Peter J. Bentley, eds. On growth, form and computers. Academic Press, 2003.).

            Historically, artistic generative plant modeling has has primarily used L-systems[x] and other formal grammars (explicit embryogenies) to create fractal-like patterns[x]. These approaches produce wonderful patterns but are limited to within a narrow range. Additionally, they attempt to mimic the forms and not the processes that give rise to them. recently within the art and design worlds, there has been a incredible increases in the complexity and beauty of emergent forms which are biologically inspired. This has been allowed, in part by he increased accessibility of both 3D printing and parallel/GPU computing resources available to artists. [Andy Lomas](http://www.andylomas.com/) uses GPU spring systems to grow massive sculptural cellular forms [x]. He recently gave a great [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOqOyb51prU) on his work. Nervous System creates generative design systems inspired by plant venation and growth models. These systems produce beautiful 3D-printed jewelry, lamps, clothing and other items. They have been leaders in both applying generative models to functional items and using these generative systems to make the design process interactive (https://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/labs/). Finally, Christoph Bader and Dominik Kolb, of both [Mediated Matter](matter.media.mit.edu) and [deskriptiv](https://deskriptiv.com/) have produced some mind-boggling methods for generating immensely complex 3D printed designs.

            The generative method used here was inspired by [experiments](https://github.com/joel-simon/CPPN-experiments/blob/master/%231%20-%20CPPN%20Experiments.ipynb) I did applying iteration to image producing CPPN's. The CPPN would use the last pixel and past neighbor states for input - essentially a game of life with evolved rules. The dynamic range of patterns with iterative-CPPNs was much greater than for regular CPPN's with the same network size and they did better too. These experiments reinforced the the necessity of iteration and/or permutation for any embryogenesis. This generative mesh method is essentially an iterative CPPN on a mesh.

            Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, is [Karl Sims](http://www.karlsims.com/evolved-virtual-creatures.html) iconic virtual creatures[x] from 1994 which was an inspiration for most people in the field. He was the first to popularize genetic algorithms for creative applications. Being twenty-four years old and still being among the most iconic works int this field is indicative of how ahead of its time it was (and perhaps how little progress there has been since.)

            Each genome consists of a neural network and vector of attributes. The forms are grown by starting with a seed mesh and using the network to control the growth of every vertex (here representing a polyp) at every growth step. The network also controls the output of reaction-diffusion morphogens and vertex-vertex signaling which allow emergent patterns to direct growth. The attributes control global properties such as decay rates for morphogens, signals and nutrients.

        p A genome also has several attributes. Each reaction-diffusion system has the diffusion and feed, and kill rates and the signal systems have diffuse and decay rates. Additionally, each coral has a nutrient diffusion rate that controls how much polyps share nutrient with their neighbors.

        :markdown
            ## Evolution
            The networks are evolved using a genetic algorithm for neural networks (neural-evolution) called [NEAT](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf). The version used also allows arbitrary attributes to be evolved independent of the network.

            Additionally, a related method called *novelty search*[] is used. Novelty search is a fascinating optimization method that operates under the belief that search spaces are deceptive and abandoning objectives and pursuing the most novel things will paradoxically also produce the best ones. A belief that has far-reaching applications to all things involving goals. Practically speaking however, this fails on very sparse search spaces and a hybrid method was taken based on [] where fitness and novelty is used. However, the geometric mean of fitness and novelty was taken over the arithmetic mean used in the paper since the fitness was not normalized or in the same range.

            The challenge of employing novelty search was creating a good metric of how different two corals were. This required creating a vector of features for each coral that could be used in nearest-neighbor search. Describing a 3D coral in away that was rotation and position invariant stumped me for a while and my original hacky methods did not yield good results. I fortunately stumbled into the world of 3D shape descriptors which try to do exactly that. Their research seems primarily motivated by allowing queries of 3D model databases. I used the D2 shape descriptor described here[] which is the histogram of distances between random pairs of points on the surface. This wonderfully elegant method captures lots of properties of the shape and is rotation and translation invariant. When the distances are normalized it is scale invariant as well. Additionally, an A2 shape descriptor is appended to that one which is a similar histogram of the angles between the normal vectors of random pairs. I have not found another use of shape descriptors for novelty search but it is a obvious pairing. The comparison the novelty vs regular is discussed below.

        h2 Morphogens

        :markdown
            Morphogens are chemicals which give rise to pattern formation during development. Reaction-diffusion is one set of equations that describe the interaction of multiple chemicals that may be used as morphogens. Varying the properties of two (U & V) chemicals can give rise to the patters seen below and are used commonly for artistic purposes. I used [gray-scott](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/amorphous/GrayScott/) over others (such as [Giererâ€“Meinhardt](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Gierer-Meinhardt_model)) because I found it more stable and that the parameter space was [well documented](https://mrob.com/pub/comp/xmorphia/). Given more time I would love to explore the relative efficacy of each model.
        img(src='http://www.karlsims.com/rd-kf-examples.png')
        p.center From <a href="http://www.karlsims.com/rd.html">karlsims.com</a>
        :markdown
            Each polyp has one input for the chemical U and one output for the chemical V. If the U chemical at the polyp is greater then 0.5 the input it set to 1, otherwise -1. Likewise, if a morpghogen output is greater than 0.5 the corresponding V is set to 1. Gray-Scott has four parameters which are evolved: the feed rate of chemical U, the kill rate of chemical V and the decay rates of both.

            In addition to reaction diffusion, there are another type of morphogens called signals which simply diffuse. These have evovled decay and diffusion rates allowing them to act as short range communication. They may evolve a range of 0 allowing polyp memory.

            ## Light
            Light is a simple vertical directional light. I use a spatial hash in the XZ plane to check for every vertex if there is another face above it. If not, the light is the angle incident to vertical. For angled lights I rotate all points around the X or Z axis. Light and shadows are givens in most graphics libraries; however, I could not find a good CPU algorithm reference. Ideally, this would include ambient and diffuse light.

        h2 Nutrients and Fluid
        p A fast and simple estimate was used for nutrient collection that did not require running a full fluid simulation, although a fast fluid simulation estimate was developed too. The grid is voxelized and nutrient collection rates are calculated for the grid. The nutrient value for a voxel is inverse to the number of vertices that are within distance <em>radius</em> of that voxel.

        img(src="/imgs/corals/flow/eqn_a.gif")

        p Where N<sub>i</sub> is the nutrients at voxel i, d<sub>ij</sub> is the distance between voxels i and j, O<sub>i</sub> indicates if voxel i is occupied, vn is the number of vertices within radius of voxel i. Then, the collection value for all polyps in a given voxel C<sub>i</sub> is the average of the nutrient values within that same competitive radius.

        img(src="/imgs/corals/flow/eqn_b.gif")
        p Where C<sub>i</sub> is the collection of voxel I and <em>n</em> is the number of voxels within the radius.

        p Although making d a binary produced similar results with a smaller radius.
        img(src="/imgs/corals/flow/CodeCogsEqn2.gif")

        p The other method tested involved a modified and iterative dijkstra's algorithm which allowed for directed current flows. Not even a poor mans fluid simulation, this is broke man's simulation. Paths are calculated form every voxel on one side of the grid to any point on the other. The travel costs of every position are then increased proportional the average amount of flow. The results of this method are not shown in this post. It produced a lower diversity of corals, most of which were fan shapes. I am currently working on hybrid methods that have local competition and directed flow.

            p <strong>Left</strong>: Example obstacles in grid. <strong>Middle</strong>: dijkstra's pathing after first iteration where costs are uniform. <strong>Right</strong>: average current flow after 5 iterations.

        p The few academic papers on coral modeling use some type of lattice-Boltzmann algorithm; however, it would be prohibitively slow to simulate a large grid for each growth step of each coral in the population for each generation. I also attempted <a href="http://www.intpowertechcorp.com/GDC03.pdf">fast fluid simulations for games</a> which was also too slow.
        p The academic papers on coral modeling only simulate a single coral at once, and spend several hours doing so, while here about ten thousands corals must be simulated per optimization. Although, [1] multiplies vertex collection rates by its surface curvature in order to get realistic effect indicating the fluid simulations are not ideal anyway.

        :markdown
            ## Visualizations
            For corals with greater than three morphogens, the first three principle components where taken, scaled to [0,1] and assigned to blue, red and green respectively. For reaction diffusion morphogens, the U component was used as the value. In this work there were five total morphogens and the total variance of first three components ranged between 90% and 99%.

            ## Fitness Function
            The fitness of a coral is the total amount of energy produced at the end of growth. Limiting the volume and scaling growth by energy prevents uncontrolled growth. For novelty search the fitness is the square root of the regular fitness times novelty where novelty is the euclidean distance of the shape descriptor from its ten nearest neighbors.

            Corals were run with NEAT for 100 generations with a population size of 80. For Novelty Search, a population size of 20 was run for 400 generations. Two main simulation parameters were varied across experiments: *light_amount* and *gradient_height*. Twelve corresponding NEAT and Novelty run were done with variations of those two parameters such that each run within a pair had exactly the same simulation and evolution parameters.

This normalizes for some environments were harder to evolve in than others. Because novelty search had a smaller population size for more generations, the x axis is normalized for total number of corals evaluated. Error bars are 0.5 sigma.

        :markdown
            The normal NEAT runs optimize more quickly than novelty; however, they quickly stagnate and fail to keep evolving after a short period (roughly evaluation 2000, generation 25). The novelty runs slow down slightly after the NEAT ones and continue to increase without plateauing. Exactly how long they continue to do so will be checked in further work but indicates the corals shown are potentially far from fully optimized.

            Given the limited abilities of each polyp and simplicity of the networks, I was pleasantly surprised with the results. Both the ability of the forms to evolve and the diversity of corals produced. For genomes with less than 100 dimensions, complex forms with ~15,000 vertexes are generated. And easily many more if allowed to run longer. Additionally, the results validated the benefits of novelty search and the efficacy of the shape descriptors as feature vectors. The results of the novelty search are congruent with the expected results of novelty search.

            Form, growth, evolution and environment are all linked making it hard to understand one removed from the others. L-systems and other elegant mathematical formulations may help to describe the patterns present in biology; however, plants and grown forms are not mathematical equations. They are a thoroughly optimized genome emergent in billions of coordinating cells adapting to their environments. I thing mimicking the methods as apposed to the results captures more of the beauty. Competition and ecosystems are equally important as well, something missing form this work. The idea of species competition gave rise to this [ecology-modeling](/ecology-modeling.html) project as discussed in this [interview](https://www.labocine.com/spotlight/146).

            Looking forward, I would like to provide a simulation engine and benchmark for machine learning researchers. There have been so many advances in reinforcement learning lately that can be applied in more beautiful and useless ways compared to the obvious military applications of the standard simulation engines.

            It's worth questioning the very attempt of mimicking as apposed to capturing nature. Where the later shows deference the former seems arrogant and delusional. Nothing man has made approaches the complexity of the human body. Perhaps it is the generative artists equivalent to the feeling of conquest that comes from climbing a mountain peak, coming from a deep impulse to dominate nature.

        //- Yet, viewing the biological motivated generative art as an attempt to capture the beauty of the biological mechanisms of pattern formation, may lead to deeper levels of appreciation and awe.
